This is my .vim directory and my .vimrc file.

I'm a Rails hacker, and work on Macs mostly. This setup works well in Terminal, too.

I map my Caps Lock key to Control (using the OS) to minimize the pinky finger work.

My basic workflow is 1) open MacVim, 2) :cd project/directory, 3) <F2> (or :NERDTree). To open a second project, I Cmd-T to open a new tab, then repeat steps 2) and 3).

My favorite time-savers are ",be" (buffer explorer to switch between opened files), ",j" (to switch between the current and last file), Ctrl-g (to open the custom grep function in a project), <tab> for tab autocompletion, and ",f" (to open the Fuzzy Finder for files).
